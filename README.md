# Project Title: EEG Data Analysis and Classification Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches

## Project Overview: 
This project aims to analyze and classify EEG (Electroencephalography) data by leveraging a mix of traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning techniques. The objective is to clean, process, and extract meaningful insights from EEG data to build models that can effectively classify signals. The project entails a thorough data preprocessing pipeline, feature extraction, and model development.

## Key Components:

Data Preprocessing: Addressing missing values, discarding non-essential columns (like SubjectID, VideoID, predefinedlabel), and optimizing features to enhance model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating visualizations such as box plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps to explore data distributions and feature relationships.
Feature Engineering: Focusing on key features from the dataset, especially the user-definedlabeln column, to extract relevant information for the classification task.
Modeling Techniques: Applying both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning architectures using TensorFlow and Keras to classify EEG signals.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance through confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.

## Dataset Information:

Source: EEG data with accompanying features representing characteristics of the recorded signals.
Key Columns: Significant columns include those representing EEG features and the user-definedlabeln, which serves as the classification target.

## Libraries and Tools:

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
Scikit-Learn: For classical machine learning models and evaluation.
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training deep learning models.

## Steps Involved:

Data Import & Cleaning: Import necessary libraries, load the dataset, manage missing values, and eliminate irrelevant columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Create visual representations to examine data distributions and relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Encode and convert the user-definedlabeln column into integer values for classification and prepare data for model input.
Modeling: Implement a variety of classical machine learning algorithms alongside deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of models using confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.

##  How to Run:

Install the required dependencies (e.g., by using pip install -r requirements.txt).
Execute the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) to clean the data, train the models, and assess performance.

## Results:

Visual insights into the data's distributions and relationships.
Performance metrics from machine learning and deep learning models for EEG signal classification.

## Future Scope:

Further fine-tuning of the deep learning models.
Expanding the dataset by incorporating additional EEG data to enhance the models' generalization capabilities.
